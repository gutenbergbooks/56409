<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the "London Gazette," from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign's Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit du Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks
of their native shore;" and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The institution of entire regiments of Light
Cavalry, as part of the standing army of Great
Britain, in the spring of 1759, was attended with
such signal success, that, after the formation of
the two splendid corps of Eliott and Burgoyne,
which were numbered the Fifteenth and Sixteenth,
King George II. was induced to carry the
plan to a still greater extent, and to augment the
Light Dragoon establishment with five additional
regiments, which were numbered the Seventeenth,
Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth, and
Twenty-first Light Dragoons. The first of these
additional corps was raised in Scotland by Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Aberdour; it never consisted of more than two
troops, and was disbanded at the termination of
the seven years' war, in 1763. The second was
embodied in Hertfordshire, under the superintendence
of Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">John Hale</span>, from the
Forty-seventh Foot, an officer who had served
with credit in Europe and America, and who was
the bearer of the public despatches announcing
the victory at Quebec on the 13th of September,
1759, and the fall of the brave Major-General
<span class="smcap">James Wolfe</span>, a name which will be ever recorded
among the heroes of the British army.</p>

<p>This corps was numbered the <span class="smcap">Eighteenth</span>
Light Dragoons; but after the reduction of Lord
Aberdour's regiment it obtained rank as Seventeenth,
and now bears the title of the "<span class="smcap">Seventeenth
Lancers</span>." Its first rendezvous was at
Watford and Rickmansworth, and it consisted of
four troops. The first troop was raised by Captain
Franklin Kirby, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'from Lientenant'">from Lieutenant</ins> in the Fifth Foot;
the second by Captain Samuel Birch, from Lieutenant
in the Eleventh Dragoons; the third by
Captain Martin Basil<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, from Lieutenant in Eliott's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Light Horse; and the fourth by Captain Edward
Lascelles, from Cornet in the Royal Horse Guards.
Of this corps, Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">John Hale</span>, whose
merits had procured for him the favour of his
sovereign, was appointed Lieut.-Colonel Commandant,
by commission dated the 7th of November,
1759; and purposing that his regiment
should consist of men of decided character, who
would emulate the glorious example of the heroic
<span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>, whose gallant conduct the Colonel had
witnessed, he procured His Majesty's authority
for his regiment to bear on its standards and appointments
the "<em>Death's Head</em>," with the motto,
"<em>Or Glory</em>," which it has continued to bear to
the present time.</p>

<p>The zeal of the officers, with the popular
feeling of interest, which existed in England at
this period, and particularly in London and the
southern counties, in favour of light cavalry,
occasioned the regiment to be speedily completed
with men and horses, and, in the beginning of
December, it marched to Warwick and Stratford
upon Avon, and soon afterwards to Coventry,
where it was augmented to six troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>In January, 1760, the following officers were
holding commissions in the regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ten months after the authority for its formation
was issued, the regiment was directed to
march to Berwick, and place itself under the
orders of the Commander-in-Chief in North Britain;
it arrived in Scotland in October, and was
stationed in that part of the United Kingdom
during the following three years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761<br />1762</div>

<p>In the spring of 1761 the regiment sent a draft
of fifty men and horses to Germany, to serve under
Lieut.-General the Marquis of Granby, and the
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and in 1762
hostilities were terminated by the treaty of Fontainbleau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The restoration of peace was followed, in
1763, by reductions in the military establishment
of the kingdom; but this was one of the corps
selected to be retained in the service, and Lieut.-Colonel
Commandant John Hale was promoted
to the colonelcy of the regiment by commission
dated the 27th of April, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>From Scotland the regiment embarked, in
1764, for Ireland, where it was stationed during
the succeeding eleven years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>The following particulars respecting the clothing
and guidons of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light

<p><span class="smcap">Quarter Masters</span>,&mdash;to have no lace or embroidery

<div class="sidenote">1770</div>

<p>Colonel John Hale, having been appointed
Governor of Limerick, was succeeded in the
colonelcy of the regiment by Colonel George
Preston, from the lieut.-colonelcy of the Scots
Greys, by commission dated the 2nd of November,
1770.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>While the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were in Ireland, they
had the reputation of being a well-disciplined and
an efficient corps, and on the breaking out of hostilities,
in 1775, between Great Britain and her
North American colonies, the high character of
the regiment occasioned it to be the first cavalry
corps selected to proceed across the Atlantic. It
embarked from Ireland towards the end of March,
and landed at Boston on the 24th of May.</p>

<p>Soon after the regiment arrived at Boston, the
American troops attempted to establish themselves
on <em>Bunker's Hill</em>, but were driven from
thence, after a sharp engagement, on the 17th of
June. During the action a party of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
volunteered to proceed dismounted with
the reinforcement sent from Boston to support
the troops engaged.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their defeat at Bunker's Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the American troops crowded round Boston in
such numbers, and constructed such extensive
works, that the British were kept in a state of
blockade on the land side, and were so distressed
for fresh provisions, that live cattle, vegetables,
and even fuel, were sent from England for their
use. These supplies proved insufficient, and the
troops endured much distress. In the mean time
the Americans, possessing every necessary article
in abundance, began to act with vigour, raising
batteries and opening a cannonade on the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>In March, 1776, the King's troops evacuated
Boston and sailed to Halifax. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
landed at Halifax, and remained in Nova Scotia
about two months; in the early part of June they
again embarked, and, sailing towards New York,
landed on Staten Island in the beginning of July.
At this place the army was reinforced with troops
from Great Britain, also with a body of Hessians;
and the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Samuel Birch, were attached to the
Highland Brigade under Brigadier-General Sir
William Erskine.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of August a landing was effected
on <em>Long Island</em>; on the 25th the American piquets
were surprised by detachments of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></span>
under Captain Oliver de Lancey; and at
nine o'clock on the evening of the 26th the regiment
led the van of the army from Flatland
across the country to seize on a pass in the
heights extending along the middle of the island.
Arriving within half a mile of the pass, an American
patrole was captured, and Lieut.-General Clinton
learning that the enemy had not taken possession
of the pass, it was immediately occupied. Passing
the heights at day-break, the regiment moved
towards Bedford, where it arrived about half-past
eight o'clock, and immediately attacked a large
body of Americans, who were quitting the woody
heights to join their army in the fortified lines at
<em>Brooklyn</em>; some desultory fighting took place, in
which the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> evinced great gallantry;&mdash;Lieutenant
William Loftus particularly distinguishing
himself,&mdash;and the Americans were driven
back with severe loss: General Sulivan, two
brigadier-generals, and ten field officers being
among the prisoners. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> routed
the American cavalry at the village of Jamaica,
and at the close of the action Lieut.-General
Clinton and Brigadier-General Sir William Erskine
thanked the officers and men of the regiment for
their gallant conduct. General Sir William Howe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
stated in his public despatch, "The behaviour of
both officers and soldiers, British and Hessians,
was highly to their honour. More determined
courage and steadiness in troops have never been
experienced, or a greater ardour to distinguish
themselves."</p>

<p>On the night of the 29th of August the
Americans abandoned their works, and crossed the
East-river to New York. Long Island having
thus been reduced, with little loss, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
embarked from thence, and, crossing the
river, took part in forcing the enemy to evacuate
New York: the regiment was also engaged in the
action at <em>Pelham-manor</em> on the 18th of October.</p>

<p>Advancing up the country the regiment joined
the army on the 20th of October, and on the 28th
it was one of the corps engaged in forcing the
passage of the Brunx River, and in chasing the
Americans to their entrenchments at the entrance
of <em>White Plains</em>. The regiment had one man
and five horses killed; Lieutenant William Loftus,
four rank and file, and three horses wounded.</p>

<p>The Americans withdrew from their lines,
when the British retired to undertake the siege of
<em>Fort Washington</em>, and at the storming of the lines
and redoubts near the fort, on the 16th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
November, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons
supported the infantry, and had one man wounded.</p>

<p>One troop of the regiment formed part of the
force under Lieut.-General Clinton, which sailed
from New York on the 1st of December, landed
on <em>Rhode Island</em> on the 8th, and overpowering the
American troops, reduced the island to submission
to the British Government. This troop remained
on Rhode Island during the succeeding twelve
months under Major-General Earl Percy, and
afterwards under Major-General Prescott. Five
troops of the regiment were stationed, during the
winter, at New York and other places in the
vicinity of that city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>The Americans having formed extensive magazines
at <em>Danbury</em> and other places on the borders
of Connecticut, a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
formed part of the force sent from New York,
under Major-General Tryon, to destroy the stores.
Sailing from New York in transports, the troops
arrived, on the evening of the 25th of April, 1777,
off Norwalk, landed without opposition, and commenced
their march at ten o'clock that night for
Danbury, where they arrived about two in the
afternoon of the following day. On their approach
the American soldiers fled, and as no carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
could be procured to bring off the stores, they
were destroyed by fire; the flames communicating
to the town, it was also consumed. On the following
morning the British commenced their
march back to their shipping, but had to fight
their way through troops assembled to oppose
them. They overthrew one body of Americans at
<em>Ridgefield</em>, routed another party at the <em>Hill of
Campo</em>, and afterwards embarked without molestation
for New York.</p>

<p>In June the army took the field, and endeavoured
to draw the American forces under General
Washington from their strong position in the
mountains in the Jerseys, but without success.
The British General afterwards embarked with
the greater part of his army on an expedition
against the populous and wealthy city of Philadelphia,
taking with him the Sixteenth Light
Dragoons, and leaving five troops of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
at New York, and one troop at Rhode
Island.</p>

<p>From New York one troop of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
embarked, dismounted, in the early part
of October, with the expedition against <em>Forts
Montgomery</em> and <em>Clinton</em>. Having landed at
Stoney-point, on the 6th of October, the troop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> formed part of the column
under Major-General Vaughan, which captured
one of the forts by storm on the same evening;
the other fort was abandoned by the Americans.</p>

<p>After returning from this enterprise the troop
rejoined the regiment at New York, and during
the winter the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> embarked for Pennsylvania,
and were stationed at Philadelphia under
General Sir William Howe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>In the spring of 1778 a succession of detachments
ranged the country for many miles round
Philadelphia, and opened communications for bringing
in supplies of provision, in which service the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were actively employed.</p>

<p>The American troops were encamped in
Valley Forge, and Captain Lord Cathcart, of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, being sent out with twenty-five
men to reconnoitre the enemy's position in the
direction of White-marsh, ascertained that a
patrole of ten American soldiers had taken possession
of a house on the road leading to that
place. The men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> surrounded
the house, and his lordship summoned the Americans
to surrender; but they had barricaded the
doors and windows, and refused to obey the summons.
A few men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> dismounted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
sent some shots through the door, and
approached the house to try the effect of cold
steel, when the Americans begged for quarter, and
were taken prisoners to Philadelphia. This excursion
of twenty-eight miles was performed
without a halt.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3rd of May a small
detachment of the regiment left Philadelphia to
co-operate with the troops destined to drive nine
hundred Americans, under Brigadier-General
Lacy, from their post at <em>Crooked Billet</em>. The
Americans retreated, but were overtaken, attacked,
and one hundred and fifty men killed,
wounded, and taken prisoners; their baggage was
also captured, and sold for the benefit of the
troops employed in this service.</p>

<p>Three thousand Americans, under the Marquis
de la Fayette, took post on <em>Barren Hill</em>,
seven miles in advance of General Washington's
camp, and a detachment of the regiment formed
part of the force sent against this portion of the
American army. On the morning of the 21st of
May, as the British approached, the Marquis de la
Fayette made a precipitate retreat; but his rear
was overtaken by the dragoons, and some execution
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The French monarch having acknowledged the
independence of the revolted British provinces,
and concluded a treaty with them, the nature of
the war became so far changed that the evacuation
of Philadelphia took place, and the army proceeded
to New York. In the march from Philadelphia,
through the Jerseys, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
were actively employed, and performed much
severe and harassing duty; the route lying through
woods, over rivers, and along difficult roads, with
the enemy hovering on the flanks and rear, occasioned
the services of the light cavalry to be
much required. On the 28th of June, as the last
brigade descended from the heights of <em>Freehold</em>, in
New Jersey, the enemy appeared in the rear and
on both flanks, and some sharp fighting took place;
when the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, being with the advance
guard, were ordered from the front to take part in
the engagement. The enemy was repulsed; the
army resumed its march, and one troop of the
regiment, being in advance, took part in putting
to flight a body of Americans. Having crossed
the channel to Sandy Hook, the army embarked
from thence for New York.</p>

<p>Soon after their return from Philadelphia the
strength of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> was increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the receipt of many effective men and all the serviceable
horses from the Sixteenth Light Dragoons,
which corps was ordered to return to Great Britain;
the horses were many of them American, as the
Sixteenth had only eighty English horses left.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>From New York the regiment was sent to the
east end of Long Island, where it remained during
the winter; and in the spring of 1779 it was
ordered to take up a position in advance of the
lines in front of New York.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> was the only British
cavalry regiment in America, and no other corps
was sent out; there were, however, several independent
troops of provincial cavalry in the British
service, also a corps, partly cavalry and partly
infantry, commanded by Captain Lord Cathcart of
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons, who held the
rank of Colonel in the provincials, and also another
corps, or "legion," as it was more frequently
called, under Colonel Banastre Tarleton. This
legion had usually a select party of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
attached to it, who wore their own uniform,
and became celebrated for their excellent conduct
on the out-post duty, also for their daring spirit of
enterprise when employed on detached services.
While serving remotely from the head-quarters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>their own uniform became worn out, and they were
offered the dress of the legion; but they were proud
of their regiment, and they preferred patching up
their old clothing to preserve the distinction<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The post occupied by the regiment in front of
New York was held for the purpose of clearing
the country of the hostile parties, and keeping the
roads clear to enable the supplies of the army to be
brought in, and skirmishes occurred almost daily.</p>

<p>Serjeant <span class="smcap">Thomas Tucker</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Light Dragoons, traversing the country with
twelve men, came suddenly upon a small American
fort, when he leapt into it and made the
garrison prisoners. <span class="smcap">Tucker</span> accompanied the
regiment from England as a volunteer; he evinced
signal bravery on all occasions, and was rewarded,
on the 10th of April, 1779, with a commission of
cornet in the regiment: he proved an efficient
officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>In the winter, when the French fleet and land
forces, after having been repulsed at Rhode Island
and Savannah, withdrew from the American coast,
General Sir Henry Clinton fitted out an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
against South Carolina, where the mildness of the
climate, the richness of the country, its vicinity to
Georgia, and its distance from the position occupied
by the American army under General Washington,
pointed out the advantage and facility of conquest.
A detachment of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons,
attached to Tarleton's legion, formed part
of the force employed on this enterprise. The
fleet sailed towards the end of December, but was
dispersed by strong gales of wind, and the tempestuous
weather occasioned the death of nearly
all the horses. The transports in which the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and Tarleton's legion were embarked,
took refuge from the tempest in the harbour of
Tybee, an island near the coast of Georgia, from
whence the officers and soldiers proceeded in boats
to the island of Port Royal, where a number of
horses of an inferior description were procured.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and Tarleton's legion were
quartered at Beaufort, from whence they proceeded
to join Brigadier-General Patterson, who
was proceeding from Savannah, with a body of
infantry, to reinforce the expedition under Sir
Henry Clinton, who had undertaken the siege of
Charlestown. The inhabitants of the country
through which the detachment had to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
having heard of the loss of the cavalry horses at
sea, many of them equipped themselves as cavaliers,
to confine the British to the line of march,
and prevent them collecting horses in the country.
Some of these cavaliers insulted the front of the
column, but were overthrown by a charge of the
dragoons, and the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> took some prisoners
and a number of horses, without any loss
on their part; but in the neighbourhood of Rantol's
bridge the Americans captured an officer and
several foot soldiers.</p>

<p>After a march of twelve days through a
country intersected with rivers, rendered difficult
by heavy rains, and infested with enemies, the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> arrived on the banks of the Ashley-river
with a large quantity of forage and some
horses, which they had collected on the march:
the cavalry of the detachment halted at Quarter
House, but the infantry joined the army before
<em>Charlestown</em>.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, 1780, the men of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> advanced, with other troops, to cut
off the communications of the garrison of Charlestown
with the adjacent country; they halted that
night at Goosecreek, and on the evening of the
following day they moved silently towards one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the enemy's posts of communication on Cooper's
river,&mdash;several corps co-operating in the movement.
At three o'clock on the following morning
the advanced guard of dragoons and mounted
infantry approached <em>Monk's Corner</em>, and charging
and routing the enemy's guard on the main road,
dashed forward into the American cavalry camp.
The enemy was surprised, all who made resistance
were speedily cut down; favoured by darkness,
General Huger, Colonels Washington and Jamieson,
and seven others, took refuge in some swampy
grounds near the camp; and one hundred and fifty
dragoons and hussars, four hundred horses, and fifty
waggons loaded with arms, ammunition, and clothing,
were captured. The enemy's infantry at
Biggin's bridge were routed by a charge with the
bayonet; the boats at Bonneau's ferry were also
seized, and the American army in Charlestown
was closely invested.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May Lieut.-Colonel Tarleton
advanced at the head of a patrole of one hundred
and fifty men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and dragoons
of the legion, to gain intelligence, when he was
overtaken by a loyal American, who informed him
that a strong body of the enemy's cavalry had
taken a British foraging party, of an officer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
seventeen mounted light infantry, prisoners, and
was moving towards <em>Lenew's ferry</em>. Stimulated
by this news, the patrole quickened its pace, and
arrived at three in the afternoon in the presence
of the enemy's videts. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> instantly
charged the American out-guard, which
was routed, and pursued upon the main body;
the enemy was surprised; five officers and thirty-six
soldiers were cut down; seven officers and
sixty dragoons were made prisoners, and Colonels
White, Washington, and Jamieson, with some
other officers and a few soldiers, escaped by swimming
across the river, but many were drowned in
the attempt.</p>

<p>The foraging party, captured by the Americans
in the morning, was rescued as the ferry-boat was
pushing off to convey the men across the river.</p>

<p>In this enterprise the British had only two
men and four horses killed; the patrole joined
the troops under Lieut.-General Earl Cornwallis
on the same evening, but upwards of twenty
horses died of fatigue.</p>

<p>Charlestown surrendered to the British arms
on the 12th of May. Soon after this event the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were attached to the troops under
Lieut.-General Earl Cornwallis, and marched up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the north-east bank of the Santee river in pursuit
of a body of Americans under Colonel Burford,
who was retreating to North Carolina. Lord
Cornwallis halted at Georgetown, from whence
forty of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, one hundred and thirty
of Tarleton's legion, a hundred mounted infantry,
and a three-pounder, followed the Americans by
forced marches. After travelling one hundred
and five miles in fifty-four hours, the detachment
approached <em>Wacsaw</em>, on the confines of South
Carolina, at three o'clock in the afternoon of the
29th of May, and the advance-guard, overtaking
the enemy's rear, took a serjeant and four American
light dragoons prisoners. Three hundred and
eighty American infantry, a detachment of cavalry,
and two six-pounders, formed for battle in an open
wood; the British, though not half so numerous,
(many men and the only gun with the detachment
being unable to keep up,) moved forward in three
columns to charge their opponents; the men of
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> being in the centre column
under Captain Talbot. The Americans remained
steady until the British were within ten yards,
and then fired a volley, which produced little
effect; and before the smoke cleared away, their
ranks were broken, and the British were cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
them down with a terrible carnage. In a few
minutes the conflict had ceased; one hundred
Americans lay dead on the spot, two hundred
were made prisoners, and three colours, two guns,
and a number of waggons containing stores and
baggage, were captured by the British, who had
only five officers and soldiers killed, and twelve
wounded; Lieutenant Matthew Pateshall, of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, being among the wounded.</p>

<p>Thus South Carolina was cleared of the
enemy's troops, and, in a few days after this exploit,
the detachment joined Earl Cornwallis at
Camden, a town situate on the east side of the
Wateree river.</p>

<p>In the mean time General Sir Henry Clinton
had returned to New York, and had left orders for
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> to follow; the detachment, accordingly,
embarked from South Carolina, leaving
the sick and a few men attached to Tarleton's legion
behind, and joined the regiment at New York,
where it had remained under General Knyphausen.</p>

<p>The Americans made great efforts to regain
possession of South Carolina; but their army of
six thousand men, under General Gates, was
routed at <em>Camden</em> by two thousand British, under
Earl Cornwallis, on the 16th of August. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> attached to Tarleton's
legion shared in the conflict. "The cavalry
completed the route with their usual promptitude
and gallantry, and after great exertions
during the action, continued the pursuit to
Hanginrock, twenty-two miles from the place
where the action commenced, during which
many of the enemy were slain, and many prisoners
taken, with one hundred and fifty waggons,
and all the baggage and camp equipage.
On the morning of the 17th Colonel Tarleton
was again despatched in pursuit, and on the 18th
surprised seven hundred men, killing one hundred
and fifty on the spot, and taking three
hundred prisoners, three cannon, and forty-four
waggons<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>During the winter reinforcements were sent
from New York to South Carolina, including a
detachment of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons,
which landed in December, and joined Earl Cornwallis's
camp on the 6th of January, 1781.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were afterwards attached
to the troops under Colonel Tarleton, who was
directed to force the Americans under General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Morgan to pass the Broad river. The British
overtook their opponents on the 17th of January,
at a place called <em>Cowpens</em>; the Seventh Royal
Fusiliers, the infantry of the legion, and a corps of
light infantry, with a troop of cavalry on each
flank, commenced the action, and soon forced the
enemy to give way; but being too eager in the
pursuit to preserve sufficient order, Morgan's
corps faced about and gave them a heavy fire;
this produced great confusion and serious loss,
including two guns. The cavalry of the legion
quitted the field, excepting about fourteen men,
who joined forty of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons,
and, at the head of this little band of
heroes, Colonel Tarleton made a desperate charge
on the whole of the American cavalry, and drove
them back on their infantry, recapturing his baggage,
and cutting to pieces the detachment of the
enemy which had taken possession of it. He
afterwards retired to Hamilton's ford.</p>

<p>Cornet Thomas Patterson of the regiment was
killed on this occasion<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and Lieutenant Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Nettles wounded; several private soldiers and
troop horses were also killed and wounded.</p>

<p>When Earl Cornwallis advanced into North
Carolina, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were left in South
Carolina, under the command of Lord Rawdon,
and had to perform duties which called forth the
intelligence, activity, and bravery of the officers
and soldiers. The occupation of posts distant
from each other gave the light cavalry left in the
province full employment in keeping up the communications.
Many of the inhabitants were hostile
to the royal cause; they performed their duties of
allegiance with reluctance, and broke their engagements
at the first opportunity: the troops
of the Congress also made incursions into the
province. These circumstances occasioned the
duties of the detachment to be particularly
harassing; the men and horses were exhausted
by constant motion along bad roads, and reduced
in numbers by continual skirmishes. While employed
in these duties instances of individual
gallantry and devotion to the interests of the
service were numerous. On one occasion, when
Private <span class="smcap">McMullins</span> was carrying a despatch to
the Commander-in-Chief, he was beset by four
militia men; he shot one, disabled another with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his sword, and brought the other two prisoners to
head-quarters<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>On another occasion a despatch of great importance
had to be forwarded to Lord Rawdon,
through a country infested by the enemy, and
Corporal <span class="smcap">O'Lavery</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, being
a man of known courage and experience, was
selected to accompany the bearer of the despatch.
They had not proceeded far before they were
attacked and both severely wounded. The bearer
of the despatch died on the road; the corporal
snatched the paper from the dying man, and rode
on until he fell from loss of blood, when, to conceal
the important secret from the Americans,
should he fall into their hands, he thrust the paper
into his wound. He was found, on the following
day, with sufficient life to point to the fatal depository
of the secret. The surgeon declared the
wound itself not to be mortal, but rendered so by
the insertion of the despatch. Corporal <span class="smcap">O'Lavery</span>
was a native of the county of Down, where a <em>monument</em>,
the gratitude of his countryman and commander,
<span class="smcap">Lord Rawdon</span>, records his fame.</p>

<p>The services of the British troops in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Carolinas, are spoken of in the 'Annual Register'
of 1781, in the following terms:&mdash;"It is impossible
to do justice to the spirit, prudence,
and invincible fortitude displayed by the commanders,
officers, and soldiers during these
dreadful campaigns in the Carolinas. They had
not only to contend with men, and those by no
means deficient in bravery or enterprise, but they
encountered and surmounted difficulties and
fatigues from climate and country that would
appear insuperable in theory, and incredible in
relation. During renewed successions of forced
marches, under a burning sun, and in seasons
inimical to man, they were frequently, when
sinking under excessive fatigue, not only destitute
of comforts, but even of necessaries that seemed
essential to existence. During the greatest part
of the time they were destitute of bread, and the
country afforded no vegetables; salt failed; and
their only resource was water and the cattle
found in the woods. It is a melancholy consideration,
that such talent, bravery, and military
virtue should have been exercised in vain."</p>

<p>During the summer of this year an attack of
the enemy on New York was apprehended, and
General Sir Henry Clinton, in a letter to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Cornwallis, dated the 11th of June, 1781, requested
that some of the troops, and, among others, the
remaining officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Light Dragoons, should be sent back to New York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>Lieut.-General George Preston was removed
on the 18th of April, 1782, to the Scots Greys,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
by General the Honourable Thomas Gage,
from the Twenty-second Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>His Majesty having been induced to concede
the independence of the United States, the war
was terminated by a treaty of peace, and in 1783
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons embarked from
New York, and returned to Ireland, where the
regiment was stationed during the succeeding
eleven years.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1784</div>

<p>In 1784 the colour of the clothing was
changed from scarlet to blue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>On the 4th of February, 1785, General Gage
was removed to the Eleventh Dragoons, and His
Majesty conferred the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
on Colonel Thomas, Earl of Lincoln, from
the half-pay of the Seventy-fifth Foot, which corps
was disbanded in 1783.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>In February, 1794, the Earl of Lincoln succeeded,
on the death of his father, to the dignity
of Duke of Newcastle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time the success of the French
republicans, who had seized the reins of government
and beheaded their sovereign, had been
followed by the adoption of republican principles
by many evil-disposed persons in Ireland, who
attempted to organize a rebellion in that part of
the United Kingdom; and the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were
employed, under Major-General Eustace, in suppressing
the proceedings of a body of rebels called
<em>Defenders</em>, in the counties of Dublin, Louth,
and Meath. The regiment was employed many
months, night and day, in this service. It was
afterwards sent to the north of Ireland, and quartered
at Lisburn, Carrickfergus, &amp;c., in consequence
of some opposition to authority made by
the Belfast volunteers. Major-General White
took the command of the troops at Belfast, and
ordered the volunteers to give up their cannon;
they refused, and barricaded the streets in one
part of the town; but the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light
Dragoons being sent for, entered Belfast in so
dashing a manner that the volunteers were dismayed,
and their commanding officer waited on
General White, and represented that they did not
understand the reason of the regiment entering
the town in so rapid and hostile a manner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that the volunteers would give up the cannon on
condition of being sent back to their quarters, to
which they proceeded on the same day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>Major-General His Grace the Duke of Newcastle
died on the 17th of May, 1795, and King
George III. conferred the vacant colonelcy on
Major-General Oliver de Lancey, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the regiment.</p>

<p>The principles of republicanism which had
involved France in anarchy and bloodshed, had
also extended their devastating influence to the
French West India islands, and the planters of St.
Domingo had sought the protection of Great
Britain against the fury of the mulattoes and
negroes who, inflamed with republican zeal, carried
massacre and devastation through the island. A
large body of troops was assembled, under Major-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby, to complete the
deliverance of the French West India Islands
from the power of the republicans, and to reduce
to obedience the insurgents in the island of St.
Vincent and Grenada, which formerly belonged to
France, but had been ceded to Great Britain by
treaty. Four troops of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> embarked
at Cork for England in August, 1795,
leaving the head-quarters in Ireland; they landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
at Portsmouth, and joined the cavalry camp at
Nestley, under Lord Cathcart, and on the 21st of
September embarked for St. Domingo. The departure
of the fleet of several hundred vessels,
escorted by a splendid division of the royal navy,
under Admiral Christian, was a scene calculated
to impress the mind with an idea of British power;
but a storm ensued which scattered the fleet, when
many vessels were lost, and others returned to
Spithead. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> arrived at the West
Indies in safety, and two troops were, for a short
time, employed as marines on board the Hermione
frigate, commanded by Captain Pigot, who was
afterwards murdered by his crew. The two troops
were eventually landed at Martinico.</p>

<p>One squadron of the regiment proceeded to
<em>Jamaica</em>, and was employed, towards the end of
1795 and in the beginning of 1796, against the
native Maroons, who had been joined by a number
of runaway slaves, and were engaged in open hostility
against the British authority. The Maroon
warriors were expert bush-fighters, and the service
against them proved destructive and severe; they
boldly engaging the troops on more than twenty
different occasions.</p>

</div>

<p>Thirty men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, with ten of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>another regiment, were stationed, under the command
of a subaltern officer, to intercept a body of
Maroons and negroes; but the latter had so
perfect a knowledge of the country that they
came upon the military by surprise. The officer
being wounded, retired to a safe post, where he
delivered the charge of the party over to Serjeant
Stephenson of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>. The Serjeant
then addressed his men in the most animating
language, and leading them to the charge in a
most spirited manner, at a moment when the
Maroon warriors did not expect an attack, he
routed the rebels and killed and wounded several
of them<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>On another occasion, when the troops were
out in quest of the Maroon bands, the dragoons
came suddenly upon a number of warriors deliberating
in council in one of their recesses called
the Cock-pit, when Lieutenant Oswald Werge
leaped in among them at the hazard of his life,
saying, "I bring you peace;" fortunately they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
not fire at him, but received him in a friendly
manner, and the consequence was, that a treaty
was entered into with them; a number of the
warriors surrendered in January, 1796, and in
March the Maroon war terminated by the surrender
of the other warriors, who were afterwards
removed from the island.</p>

<p>Five troops, with the head-quarters of the
regiment, embarked from Ireland for St. Domingo
on the 25th of February, 1796.</p>

<p>One squadron had, in the mean time, been
selected to form part of the force to be employed
in reducing to obedience the insurgents in the
island of <em>Grenada</em>, whose atrocious conduct had
procured them the designation of brigands.
Having landed on the south of Port Royal, the
troops, under Brigadier-General Nicolls, advanced,
on the 25th of March, to attack the enemy, who
occupied a strong position on a hill of steep ascent.
During the action two vessels arrived from Guadaloupe
with reinforcements for the enemy, and
were landing men on the beach, when the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
were ordered to interpose between them
and the fort. Passing swiftly along a lane strewed
with killed and wounded, exposed to the fire of
both parties, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> reached the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and instantly charging, put every enemy to the
sword that had landed; no quarter being given.
When this service was completed, the cannonading
was so hot on both sides, that the squadron
could not return without being destroyed, and it
took post under the cover of a hill. The infantry
having gained the crest of the enemy's position
and carried the redoubt by storm, the republican
troops fled in dismay,&mdash;some throwing themselves
down precipices, and others escaping through the
thick underwood; when they arrived at the low
grounds, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> under Captain John
Black, and St. George's troop of light cavalry,
darted upon them and slew three hundred men in
the space of a few hundred yards<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
were commended in orders for their distinguished
conduct; their loss was limited to one
horse killed, four men and two horses wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> took part in several other
operations and skirmishes; in June the Commandant
of the French troops at Goyave surrendered,
and a number of brigands retired,
under a desperate and atrocious character named
Fedon, to their strong hold in the mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
where they were invested and forced to submit.
In addition to Captain Black, Captain Johnson,
Lieutenant Werge, and Cornet Brown of the regiment
were also engaged at Grenada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>Four troops of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were sent to
<em>St. Domingo</em>, where they served against the republican
troops, and signalized themselves at Fort
Raimond, Irois, and Morne Gautier; but the
climate of this island proved so injurious to the
health of the British soldiers that it was eventually
abandoned.</p>

<p>After losing many officers and soldiers in the
West Indies, the regiment embarked for England,
where it arrived in August, 1797; the head-quarter
ship, the Caledonia, foundered at sea;
the men were saved by boats, and taken on
board the Britannia, of Bristol; but the baggage
and regimental books were lost. On its arrival in
England the regiment received about four hundred
recruits, also a large draft from the Eighteenth
Light Dragoons, and it was soon restored
to a state of efficiency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798<br />1799</div>

<p>In 1798 a Serjeant's party of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
was attached to the expedition under Major-General
Eyre Coote, which sailed from Margate,
on the 14th of May, for the purpose of destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the basin, gates, and sluices of the Bruges canal,
to interrupt the communication between <em>Ostend</em>
and Holland. A landing was effected on the 19th
of May, and the works were destroyed; but while
this was taking place, the wind and surf became
so high that the troops could not re-embark, and
they were attacked by superior numbers, and
forced to surrender. The detachment of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> was among the troops made prisoners,
and it was sent to Lisle; it was afterwards
exchanged, and on rejoining the regiment in the
spring of 1799, such had been its exemplary conduct,
that the Serjeant, (William Brown,) was
promoted to a cornetcy in the Waggon Train,
from which he was transferred to the regiment,
and eventually became a captain in the corps;
and the private soldiers were appointed non-commissioned
officers.</p>

<p>Two squadrons were ordered to Portsmouth to
embark for Egypt, but the order was countermanded,
and they rejoined the head-quarters at
Swinley, near Windsor, where the regiment was
encamped during the summer.</p>

<p>This year a second Lieut.-Colonel was added
to the establishment, which was augmented to ten
troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>After encamping on Bagshot heath, in the
summer of 1800, the regiment was employed in
suppressing riots, occasioned by the high price of
provision, and it exhibited much forbearance under
many aggravated assaults from the populace, especially
at Duffield, where many soldiers were
hurt, and several men of the regiment were afterwards
invalided in consequence of the injuries
received on this and other occasions: Captain
Werge received a shot through his helmet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801<br />1802</div>

<p>At a general muster at Manchester, in 1801,
the regiment had upwards of a thousand non-commissioned
officers and soldiers on parade, and
nearly a thousand horses: but at the peace of
Amiens, in 1802, the establishment was reduced
to eight troops. The horses of one of the reduced
troops were valued, by a dealer, at an average of
forty guineas each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>Having embarked for Ireland in May, 1803,
the regiment experienced much severe weather
on the passage; it landed at Dublin, and war with
France having been resumed, two troops were
added to the establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>Four troops joined the force encamped, under
Lord Cathcart, on the Curragh of Kildare, in
August, 1804.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In the winter of 1805 the regiment embarked
for England, in the expectation of engaging in
active warfare on the Continent; but the results
of the victory gained by Buonaparte over the
Austrians and Russians at Austerlitz, occasioned
the order to proceed on foreign service to be
countermanded.</p>

<p>On landing in England the head-quarters proceeded
to Northampton, where the regiment was
inspected by Major-General Sir Henry Warde,
who informed the commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Evan Lloyd, that he had been sent to
examine the regiment in consequence of it being
supposed to be unfit for service; but that he
should report it composed of the finest men, the
best horses, and equipped with the best appointments
of any corps he had inspected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In April, 1806, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> marched to
the vicinity of London, and were reviewed on
Wimbledon common by their Royal Highnesses
the Prince of Wales and Duke of York. The
Prince of Wales most graciously shook hands
with Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd, and wished him joy
on so fine a corps, as did also several other
general officers present on that occasion, and
the Duke of York expressed his gratification in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
very strong terms, at witnessing the appearance of
the corps and its correct manœuvring.</p>

<p>In September the regiment was suddenly
ordered to prepare for foreign service; two troops
were separated to form a depôt; and eight troops,
having given up their horses, sailed from Spithead,
on the 5th of October, for South America, to
engage in hostilities against the Spanish provinces
in that part of the world. Entering the
splendid and capacious harbour <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Rio de Janiero'">of Rio de Janeiro</ins>,
the capital of Brazil, information was received of
the re-capture of Buenos Ayres by the Spaniards;
but arrangements, were, nevertheless, made for
carrying on the war in the Spanish dominions in
South America, and the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, having
only short carbines, were ordered to be armed
with Spanish muskets, and to serve as infantry.
Leaving Rio de Janeiro, the fleet sailed to the Rio
de la Plata; two hundred miles up this immense
river stands the city of Buenos Ayres, where the
stream is about thirty miles broad; but an attack
on this place was deferred, and the commander of
the expedition, Brigadier-General Samuel Auchmuty,
resolved to proceed against <em>Monte Video</em>,
a town situate in a small bay on the north side of
the river, one hundred and twenty miles from
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In the middle of January, 1807, a landing was
effected nine miles from Monte Video, and the
army advanced towards that fortress, when the
column, composed of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, four
troops of the Twentieth, and two of the Twenty-first
Light Dragoons, was attacked by the enemy.
Some sharp fighting occurred; Brigadier-General
Auchmuty's charger was killed, and he mounted
one of Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd's horses; his orderly
trumpeter, Thomas Hudson, had also his horse
killed under him; but eventually the British
dragoons drove back their opponents, and took up
the first position before the fortress, about two
miles from the citadel. On the 20th of January a
numerous body of men sallied from the town, but
were driven back, and on the 22nd a number of
the enemy approached the rear of the British
line, when a skirmish ensued, in which the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
had two men killed and three wounded.
During the siege the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were employed
in covering the troops before the town and in
bringing up provisions, in the performance of
which service they took many prisoners, and
Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd received the personal thanks
of Brigadier-Generals Auchmuty and Lumley.
The town was taken by storm on the 3rd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
February; on this occasion the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
formed part of the division under Brigadier-General
Lumley, in readiness to cover and support
the attack, and to protect the rear; on the capture
of the town the citadel surrendered.</p>

<p>Abundance of horses being found in the
country, the regiment was mounted; but great
difficulty was experienced in procuring forage.
Lieut.-Colonel Lloyd proceeded above twenty
miles up the country, with four troops of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, and two squadrons of the Twentieth
and Twenty-first Light Dragoons, and occupied
the out-posts of Canelon and St. Joseph, the latter
situate on the bank of a river of the same name.
In the early part of March Captain Ross's troop
was sent to Las Penais, and Captain Supple's to
Cosa Negro barracks; and on the 1st of May the
regiment had two hundred and twenty-four mounted
and three hundred and seventy-one dismounted
men in cantonments in and about Monte Video.</p>

<p>The arrival of Lieut.-General Whitelocke with
additional troops, and afterwards of Brigadier-General
Craufurd with a further reinforcement,
was followed by an attack on the city of <em>Buenos
Ayres</em>. Embarking from Monte Video, the troops
sailed nearly a hundred miles further up the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and then landed on the right bank, about thirty
miles from the city. Four dismounted troops of
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were left, with a regiment of
foot, to escort the artillery from the place of disembarkation;
and the four mounted troops, mustering
forty men each, under Lieut.-Colonel Evan
Lloyd, were employed as follows:&mdash;Two troops
were ordered to give up their horses to the commissariat,
but on putting on the pack-saddles the
horses broke loose, and were of little use: thirty
mounted men remained under Captain Lloyd, to
superintend the landing of provision,&mdash;of these,
ten were sent forward after the army with despatches,
twelve mounted men were attached to
one of the infantry brigades, and the remainder
accompanied Lieut.-General Whitelocke. Thus
this small mounted cavalry force was so employed,
that it was not available for the more important
services of the expedition.</p>

<p>Advancing through a difficult country, the
army arrived at the suburbs of Buenos Ayres,
and, on the morning of the 5th of July, penetrated
the streets of the town; a number of the enemy
collected in the rear of the army was dispersed by
sixteen mounted men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and
thirty dismounted men of the Ninth Light Dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
under Lieut.-Colonel Torrens and Captain
Whittingham. While advancing along the streets
of this populous city, the British infantry were
attacked by the whole male population, who
crowded the windows and tops of the flat-roofed
houses, and assailed the British with musketry,
hand-grenades, bricks, and large stones. Fiercely
braving this tempest of war, the English soldiers
pressed forward; in some places they were victorious,
in others they were overpowered and
forced to surrender; and in the midst of this
scene of carnage and confusion, sixteen men of
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and fifty infantry soldiers,
led by Captain Whittingham, opened a communication
with Brigadier-General Auchmuty's brigade.
Ten mounted men of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
and some infantry, also communicated with
Colonel Mahon's brigade left at the village of
Reduction: but hostilities were terminated by a
treaty, in which Lieut.-General Whitelocke agreed
to surrender the posts he had taken, also Monte
Video, and withdraw from the country, for which
he was brought to trial and cashiered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> left South America in November;
they put into Cork harbour from stress
of weather, and were mustered there on the 24th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of December; but leaving that port in January,
1808, they sailed to Portsmouth, and, after disembarking,
joined the depôt troops at Chichester.
At this place they remained six weeks dismounted,
under orders for the East Indies; furloughs were
given to the men to the 20th of February, and
such was the excellent spirit which prevailed, that
at the expiration of the term there was only one
absentee,&mdash;a man detained by sickness.</p>

<p>On the 29th of February the regiment left
Chichester; on arriving at this place the men had
large balances to receive; on quitting, they were
thanked by the mayor and corporation, who stated
that they had spent three thousand pounds in the
town in six weeks, without a single dragoon misbehaving
himself.</p>

<p>Eight hundred non-commissioned officers and
soldiers of the regiment embarked from Portsmouth
under Major Cotton, (Lieut.-Colonel Evan
Lloyd being detained as an evidence on the trial
of Lieut.-General Whitelocke,) and arrived at the
Cape of Good Hope on the 1st of June. On the
4th they were inspected by the Commander-in-Chief
at the Cape, Major-General the Honourable
Henry George Grey, who had formerly commanded
the regiment, and was then a Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
on its establishment; he expressed himself
highly pleased with their appearance; and
they fired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</i> in honour of the birth-day
of King George III.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance, connected with
the movements of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons
is shown by the following statement,
viz:&mdash;the celebration of the birth-day of His
Majesty by the regiment in the four different
quarters of the world in four successive years;
viz., in 1806 in <em>Europe</em>, in England; in 1807 in
<em>America</em>, at Monte Video; in 1808 in <em>Africa</em>, at
the Cape of Good Hope; and in 1809 in <em>Asia</em>, at
Surat, in the East Indies.</p>

<p>From the Cape of Good Hope the regiment
sailed for Calcutta. On approaching the Ganges
a fire broke out in one of the ships, the Hugh
Inglis, through the carelessness of a petty officer;
the magazine was instantly inundated, and the
engines from the other ships assisting, the fire
was extinguished without serious damage. On
the following day the three top-masts were carried
over the side of the ship by a squall, and with
them fourteen or fifteen men; but the wind
speedily subsiding, and the boats of the fleet rendering
assistance, all the men were saved except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
one. On arriving at Diamond Harbour, the regiment
was removed on board of small vessels, and
it landed at Calcutta on the 25th of August,&mdash;mustering
seven hundred and ninety men.</p>

<p>The regiment performed garrison duty at Fort
William from August to December, during which
time Major Cotton, the regimental quarter-master,
and sixty-two non-commissioned officers
and soldiers died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>Having been placed on the Bombay establishment,
the regiment embarked from Calcutta
under Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd, and arrived at
Bombay on the 1st of February, 1809. It was
destined to occupy quarters in the province of
Guzerat,&mdash;a peninsula formed by the Arabian sea
and the gulfs of Cambay and Cutch, and proceeding
to Surat,&mdash;a city situate on a fertile
plain, on the left bank of the Tappi river,&mdash;it was
there mounted on horses of a superior description,
furnished by an eminent native dealer, named
Soonderjie, for 450 and 500 rupees each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed at Surat,
four troops were detached against the followers
of a Mahomedan fanatic, who called himself
Jesus, the son of Mary, and had collected much
treasure. The inhabitants of the village of <em>Burding</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
having joined this fanatic, refused to pay
tribute, and the detachment of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>,
under Major Supple, formed part of the force
sent to reduce them to obedience to the law.
As the dragoons approached the village, an immense
crowd of these enthusiasts was discovered,
and they were summoned to surrender, and to
give up their leader; but they refused, with loud
shouts in anticipation of victory. A feint attack
was made to intimidate them, but they threw
clouds of dust in the horses' faces, and dared the
dragoons to the encounter. The soldiers then
charged; the fanatics fought with spears, and
with small hatchets, or javelins, fixed to the end
of bamboos, twelve or fourteen feet in length,
with which they inflicted severe wounds; but
they were overpowered, and cut down or dispersed.
Their leader, and four of his companions,
escaped, with their treasure, on swift camels.
On the arrival of some infantry and guns, the
village was razed to the ground. One corporal
and two private soldiers were killed; all the
officers, several private soldiers, and many of the
horses were wounded: Lieutenant Adams had
his helmet cut to pieces from his head.</p>

<p>Leaving Surat, the regiment marched, in
December, 1811, for its new cantonments at
Ruttapore, near Kaira, in the northern division
of Guzerat, where a commodious set of buildings
had been erected on a beautiful site near the
river, under the direction of Captain Goodfellow,
of the Bombay Engineers, expressly for the use
of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>. Around the regimental
cantonments the officers erected very handsome
and substantial houses of stone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1812, Colonel Evan
Lloyd was promoted to the rank of Major-general,
and the Honourable Lincoln Stanhope
was appointed Lieut.-Colonel in the regiment, in
addition to Lieut.-Colonel Wm. Carden, who was
appointed in 1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The regiment had not occupied its new cantonments
many months before it was visited by
the epidemical fever frequently so destructive in
the fruitful province of Guzerat, and it carried off
many thousands of the natives, and numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Europeans. In the months of October, November,
and December, 1812, and January, 1813,
four officers and seventy-three men of the regiment
died, chiefly of this disease. This was followed
by an equally destructive famine in Guzerat,
and the provinces to the westward, where no rain
had fallen during the two preceding years. Vegetation
had nearly ceased altogether; the rivers
were reduced to mere rills, and the nearly exhausted
springs allowed a very limited irrigation
around the villages. Under this affliction, hundreds
of the natives died daily, and Guzerat,
which is celebrated as one of the richest provinces
of the Mogul empire, abounding in rice, corn,
sugar, fruits of various kinds, cattle, and game,
presented a barren and woful spectacle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814<br />1815</div>

<p>In the years 1813, 1814, and 1815, strong
detachments of the regiment were employed in
active service in the field, under the command
of General Sir George Holmes, and Colonels
Barclay and East. In December, 1815, the regiment
formed part of the force which penetrated
the barren and mountainous province of <em>Cutch</em>,
a country abounding in lofty hills, extensive
woods, and uncultivated plains, where the natives
breed very fine horses. Into this country British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
troops had never before penetrated; and the
army had to traverse a sandy tract of land,
separating Cutch from Guzerat, called the Runn.
This tract presented a wild and singular aspect;
it appeared as an arm of the sea from which the
ocean had receded, or the dry bed of an immense
river, ten miles broad, and devoid of verdure or
vegetation. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, being at the head
of the army, entered this sandy waste between
six and seven o'clock in the morning; in some
places the ground was hard and safe; in others,
insulated quicksands offered some obstruction,
which would have proved serious impediments in
the night; and broad streaks of saline incrustations
giving to the ground the appearance of being
covered with snow, were met with; also prawns
and mullet dried in the sun; the tracts of large
birds were also seen, and on approaching the
opposite bank the traces of wild apes were perceptible.
In three hours the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
reached the boundary of this sandy waste, without
having met with hostile opposition, which had
been expected. The European infantry crossed
the Runn in three hours and a half, and the main
body, with the cannon, which had to be dragged
by ropes in some places, in four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Having entered the territory of Cutch, the
army marched towards Booge-booge, the capital,
and besieged the town and fort of <em>Anjar</em>, which
surrendered at discretion. In this service Lieutenant
Oliver de Lancey, of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>,
was severely wounded in the arm. The capture
of Anjar was followed by the surrender of the
hill-fort and fortified city of <em>Booge-booge</em>, and a
treaty of alliance was afterwards concluded with
the State of Cutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The troops re-crossed the Runn at the Mattra-pass,&mdash;a
headland between the gulfs of Cutch and
Cambay, where the tide of the Indian ocean
rushes in with a deafening noise, and a detachment
from the army was employed in destroying
the fastnesses of the banditti, whose depredations
had been destructive to the neighbouring territories;
also in reducing the power of a piratical
tribe which infested the neighbouring seas. After
the capture of the strong fort of <em>Dwarka</em>, and the
capture and dispersion of a fleet of pirates, the
field force broke up, and the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light
Dragoons returned to their beautiful cantonments
at Ruttapore in May, 1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The predatory incursions of the <em>Pindarees</em> occasioned
the regiment again to take the field in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the year 1817<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and these bands of robbers being
formidable in numbers, and all horsemen, the
troops employed against them had to perform
many forced marches, to pass rivers and thickets,
and to be constantly endeavouring to surprise
these hordes of marauders. While several corps
were pursuing the Pindarees, a number of the
native princes were preparing to engage in hostilities
against the British. The <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
formed part of the force under Major-General Sir
William Grant Keir, assembled at Baroda, which
force subsequently marched into the Malwar, and
joined the army commanded by Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Hislop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>On the second day's march from Baroda, the
rear-guard and baggage of the army were attacked
by a formidable body of <em>Bheels</em>,&mdash;robbers of a
daring and desperate character. A squadron of
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
the Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, proceeded to
the support of the infantry engaged, and, on
coming up, soon decided the affair, by cutting
down a number of the robbers, and driving the
remainder into the jungle. Lieut.-Colonel the
Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, Captain Adams,
Cornets Smith and Marriott, evinced signal spirit
and bravery on this occasion: Cornet Marriott
and his horse were severely wounded. Serjeant-Major
Hampson, a brave soldier, received an
arrow in his mouth, which pierced the spine; he
pulled the arrow from the wound, threw it down,
then drew his pistol and shot the Bheel archer
from whom the arrow came; but he immediately
fell from his horse to rise no more, the flow of
blood from his wound having suffocated him.
The regiment had several men and horses wounded
in this affair, which occurred on the 8th of December.
On the following day Lieut.-Colonel the
Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, the officers, and
soldiers of the squadron, were thanked in field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
orders; the spirit and steadiness they evinced
were particularly commended, and the prompt
and active exertions of the officers were especially
noticed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>Continuing to take an active part in the operations
of the field, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> were again
engaged on the 19th of January, 1818, and on the
21st of that month the following division order
was issued:&mdash;"The Major-General is happy to
express his approbation of the conduct of Lieut.-Colonel
the Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, and
His Majesty's <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons, in
the affair of the 19th instant, and can only
attribute the trifling loss they sustained to
the gallantry and rapidity of the attack, which
added to the complete surprise in incapacitating
the enemy for preparing for resistance. The
Major-General has not failed to bring to the
notice of his Excellency, Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Hislop, and the Commander-in-Chief in
Bombay, his sense of the spirit evinced by the
regiment on that occasion."</p>

</div>

<p>The following account of an affair between a
detachment of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> and a party of
<em>Pindarees</em>, was published in division orders, dated
the 13th of March, 1818:&mdash;"The Major-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>is happy to publish to the division the following
particulars of an action between a detachment
of His Majesty's <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'under the commmand'">under the command</ins> of Lieut.-Colonel the
Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, and a body of
<em>Pindarees</em>, commanded by Settoo in person,
which has added much to the deserved reputation
of that gallant corps, and reflects the
highest credit on the officers and men employed
on this occasion.</p>

<p>"Information having been communicated to
Lieut.-Colonel Stanhope that a considerable
party of Pindarees had appeared within a forced
march of his camp, a detachment was immediately
put in motion, and arrived in sight of
the enemy after a march of thirty miles. The
dragoons immediately formed and attacked the
Pindarees, who, after a show of resistance,
betook themselves to flight, closely pursued by
the detachment, which cut down upwards of
two hundred horsemen. Settoo, conspicuous by
his dress and black charger, narrowly escaped
falling into our hands; he was saved by the
extraordinary speed of his horse. The Major-General
begs to express his thanks to Lieut.-Colonel
the Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the promptitude and vigour with which the
arrangements were made for the attack, and the
spirit with which it was conducted; and he
returns his acknowledgments to the whole of
the detachment for the intrepidity and activity
which it displayed during the attack and pursuit
of the enemy. The conduct of Captain Adams
and Cornet Marriott having been represented
to the Major-General in the most favourable
terms, he is happy to express his unqualified
approbation of the gallantry of both these
officers."</p>

<p>On the 14th of March the following statement
appeared in division orders:&mdash;"Having made
arrangements for the return of the force into
cantonments, the Major-General cannot deny
himself the satisfaction of expressing his sentiments
on the exemplary conduct of the troops
he has had the honour to command during the
late service. Their cheerfulness in the performance
of their duty, though unavoidably harassing
and severe; the spirit and activity with which
they have always encountered fatigues; and,
above all, their strict adherence to discipline
and subordination, reflects the highest credit on
both officers and men, and merits the Major-General's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
warmest approbation. He only regrets
that circumstances have not afforded the
whole of the troops such an opportunity of displaying
their most brilliant talents, as their
companions in arms have so gallantly availed
themselves of. To conclude, he can only say,
that he has never been, in any part of the
world, with troops whom he should be so happy
to have the honour to command again, or with
whom he would so willingly undertake the most
arduous services. Where almost every officer
has so much distinguished himself by zeal,
alacrity, and good conduct, it is difficult to particularize
any individual; but Sir William Grant
Keir feels himself bound, both in gratitude
and duty, to say, that he is, in an uncommon
degree, indebted to Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable
Lincoln Stanhope, of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Light Dragoons, and to Captain Thompson, of
the same corps, who has also done more than
his duty in taking charge of the advanced-posts
during the whole of the service: the Major-General
requests the above officers will accept
of his warmest thanks."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>After reposing a short period in cantonments,
the regiment again took the field towards the end
of the year 1818; and, in the early part of 1819,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
it marched into the province of Candeish. In the
same year a detachment of eighty-six officers and
soldiers,&mdash;convalescents left at Kaira on the
march of the regiment into Candeish,&mdash;joined the
force assembled in the province of Cutch, under
Major-General Sir William Grant Keir. The extirpation
of the <em>Pindarees</em>, a community of robbers
associated for the undisguised object of subsisting
by plunder, and amounting to from twenty-five
to thirty thousand horsemen, was become an
imperative duty to the British subjects in India.
At the same time several native princes considered
that the preservation of the Pindarees
might be of advantage to themselves in the event
of a war with the British. The operations of
the armies which took the field, therefore, embraced
several objects, which were acomplished
to the honour of the British arms. After the
surrender of Nagpore, the capital of the Mahratta
territories, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> returned to
their cantonments in the fruitful province of
Guzerat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>In the month of May, 1820, the regiment
marched once more to the hilly country of Cutch,
and formed part of the force assembled in that
province, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
the Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, and encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at Keyrah, about half-way between the city of
Booge-booge and Mandivie, the principal seaport
in Cutch. This force consisted of between five
and six thousand men; but the difference between
the British authorities and the native chiefs,
against whom it was designed to act, having been
settled without an appeal to arms, the camp broke
up in November, when the troops returned to
their cantonments, excepting a detachment, which
crossed the gulf of Cutch and captured, after an
obstinate and desperate resistance, the strong
pirate fort of <em>Dwarka</em>, where Lieutenant William
Henry Marriott was mortally wounded. This
distinguished officer was aide-de-camp to the
Honourable the Governor in Council, and brigade-major
to Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable Lincoln
Stanhope; he was possessed of every quality that
could make a young soldier the object of interest
and of hope; he was admired, respected, and
beloved in life, and he met with a death of glory
without fear and without reproach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>The regiment marched back to its cantonments
near Kaira, where it was stationed until
1822, when arrangements were made for its
return to England. During the fourteen years
it had been in India, it had received, at various
times, nine hundred and twenty-nine officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
recruits from Great Britain; and its loss by
deaths, from disease and climate, exclusive of
men killed by the enemy and invalids, amounted
to eight hundred and twenty-two officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August, 1822, His Majesty
King George IV. was pleased to approve of the
regiment being equipped as a corps of "<span class="smcap">Lancers</span>."</p>

<p>On the decease of General Oliver de Lancey,
the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on
Major-General Lord Robert Edward Henry Somerset,
K.C.B., from the late Twenty-first Light
Dragoons, by commission dated the 9th of September,
1822.</p>

<p>Leaving the men who had volunteered into
other corps at Kaira, the regiment commenced
its march for Cambay, in November, and embarked
at that place in boats for Bombay, where
it arrived in December.</p>

17th Lancers, 1829.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>On the 9th of January, 1823, the regiment
sailed for England; arriving at Gravesend, on
the 18th of May, it landed and marched to
Chatham, where it was joined by Lieut.-Colonel
Stanhope and Captain Adams, who had returned
to England over-land, via Egypt. At Chatham
the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> returned their carbines into
store, and were armed with <span class="smcap">Lances</span>, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>officers and soldiers commenced wearing moustaches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>The regiment was recruited to 311 men by
the 1st of January, 1824; in June it marched to
London, and was stationed a short time in the
Regent's Park barracks, during the absence of
the Life Guards for the purpose of being reviewed.
In July the head-quarters removed to
Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In the summer of 1825 the regiment again
took the London duty, during the absence of the
household cavalry, and was subsequently removed
to Brighton and Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826<br />1827</div>

<p>The regiment marched, in the spring of 1826,
to Exeter and Topsham; in January, 1827, it
was stationed at Hounslow and Hampton-Court,
and on the 20th of that month it was on duty on
the occasion of the funeral of His late Royal
Highness the Duke of York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>From Hounslow the regiment marched to
Liverpool, and embarking for Ireland, landed at
Dublin in April, 1828, after an absence of upwards
of twenty-three years from that part of the
United Kingdom. On landing it marched to
Dundalk and Belturbet; it returned to Dublin
in May, 1829.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Lord R. E. H. Somerset was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
appointed to the Royal Dragoons in November,
1829, and the command of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Lancers was conferred by His Majesty on Major-General
Sir John Elley, K.C.B., K.C.H.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In May, 1830, the head-quarters proceeded
to Newbridge; and soon after the accession of
King William IV., on the 26th of June, the regiment
was directed to wear scarlet clothing, with
yellow lace, and blue trowsers; and to discontinue
the moustaches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>On the 1st of April, 1831, the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
marched from Limerick; and it performed much
harassing and severe duty in consequence of the
disturbed state of the county of Clare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded to Dublin in April,
1832; it there lost three men from the cholera
morbus; in June it embarked for Bristol, and it
was designed to occupy quarters at Gloucester,
but did not enter that city for several days for
fear of communicating the cholera. The head-quarters
proceeded thither on the 29th of June;
but the cholera having broken out in Gloucester
they were withdrawn to Wotton-under-Edge and
Dursley. In November, the cholera having
ceased, they returned to Gloucester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>In March, 1833, the regiment proceeded to
Hounslow, Hampton-Court, and Kensington; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on the 10th of September it was reviewed at
Windsor by His Majesty, who was graciously
pleased to express to Major-General Sir John
Elley, and to Lieut.-Colonel Lord Bingham, his
royal approbation of its appearance, using the
expression, "It is perfect." After the review the
officers had the honour to dine with the King, in
St. George's Hall, Windsor Castle, and His
Majesty repeated the expressions of his high
approbation of the appearance and movements
of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Lancers, and added, that he
had the gratification of reviewing this regiment
half a century before, when it was stationed at
New York.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1834<br />1835<br />1836<br />1837</div>

<p>From Hounslow, the head-quarters marched
in May, 1834, to Leeds; in May, 1835, the regiment
proceeded to Manchester; and in April,
1836, the head-quarters were removed to Ipswich,
from whence they proceeded, in May, 1837, to
Coventry.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838</div>

<p>The regiment embarked at Liverpool, in June,
1838, for Ireland, and was employed on duty at
Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Elley died in January,
1839, and was succeeded by Lieut.-General Sir
Joseph Stratton, K.C.H., who was removed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Eighth Dragoons in August, and the colonelcy
was conferred on Major-General Sir Arthur Benjamin
Clifton, K.C.B., K.C.H.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1840</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Dublin until May,
1840, when it proceeded to Cahir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>In May, 1841, the regiment returned to
Dublin, from whence it embarked for Scotland,
and arrived at Glasgow at the end of that month.
It was removed to Edinburgh in the month of
August following.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p>The usefulness and efficiency of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Regiment of Lancers;&mdash;the steadiness, good
conduct, and attention to the rules of discipline,
evinced by the soldiers;&mdash;and the admirable quality
and training of the horses, afford abundant proof
of the zealous and constant superintendence of the
officers, and their regard to the credit and honour
of the corps. The expressions of approbation of
the gallantry of the regiment when employed on
active service, as announced, on several occasions,
in public orders;&mdash;and the testimony borne by the
general officers under whom it has, from time to
time, been employed, to the excellence of its appearance,
system, and conduct,&mdash;fully support the
claim of the regiment to the favour of the crown,
the confidence of the government, and the admiration
of the country.</p>

<p class="center smcap">John Hale,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 27th April, 1763</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hale</span> held a commission in the Forty-seventh
Foot, and served in Scotland during the rebellion of
1745-6. He was promoted to Captain in 1752, and
to the Majority of the regiment in 1755. On the
breaking out of the seven years' war he proceeded
with the Forty-seventh to North America, and was promoted
to the Lieut.-Colonelcy of the regiment on the
19th of March, 1758. He commanded the Forty-seventh
regiment in the expedition against Cape Breton,
under Lieut.-General, afterwards Lord, Amherst; was
distinguished for intrepidity at the landing on the 8th
of June, 1758, and also served with credit at the siege
of Louisburg, which surrendered on the 26th of July.
On the 30th of August he embarked with his regiment
from Louisburg, and proceeded to the support of
Major-General Abercromby, who had been repulsed in
an attack on the French fort of Ticonderago, on the
west shore of Lake Champlain. In 1759 he commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the Forty-seventh in the expedition against
Quebec, under Major-General <span class="smcap">James Wolfe</span>, and
when appointed to this arduous enterprise, he was
honoured with the local rank of Colonel in America.
Sailing up the river St. Lawrence a landing was effected,
and several actions took place, in which Colonel Hale
was distinguished for the cool and steady manner in
which he led the Forty-seventh into the fight. At the
battle of Quebec, on the 13th of September, 1759,
Major-General <span class="smcap">Wolfe</span> fell, mortally wounded, while in
the act of leading the Twenty-eighth Foot to the charge
with bayonets; Colonel <span class="smcap">Hale</span> brought the Forty-seventh
into action in a very gallant manner, and the
charge of the two regiments (Twenty-eighth and Forty-seventh)
was irresistible. After the surrender of
Quebec, Colonel <span class="smcap">Hale</span> was selected to proceed to
England with despatches, and he arrived in London on
the evening of the 16th of October. He was well
received at Court, and being a talented officer, well
acquainted with the nature of the service of cavalry,
infantry, and artillery, his merits procured him the
favour of his Sovereign.</p>

<p>A few months previous to Colonel Hale's arrival in
England, King George II. had resolved to add to his
land forces entire regiments of light cavalry; soon after
the victory at Quebec was made known, His Majesty
reviewed the first of these regiments, "Eliott's Light
Horse," in Hyde Park, and was so much pleased with
its appearance and activity, that Colonel <span class="smcap">Hale</span> was
appointed to superintend the formation of an additional
light regiment, now the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth Lancers</span>, of
which he was appointed Lieut.-Colonel Commandant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
on the 7th of November, 1759, and Colonel on the
27th of April, 1763. In 1770 he was appointed
Governor of Limerick, when he was succeeded in the
colonelcy of his regiment by Colonel Preston. He was
promoted to the rank of Major-General in 1772, to that
of Lieut.-General in 1777; and to that of General on
the 12th of October, 1793. He died on the 20th of
March, 1806, at the Plantations, near Guisborough,
Yorkshire, leaving behind him seventeen children.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">George Preston,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 2nd November, 1770</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Preston</span> was many years an officer in the
Scots' Greys, and served with his regiment in 1743 at
the battle of Dettingen, where the Greys captured the
white standard of the French household troops. The
Greys also served at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745,
at Roucoux in 1746, and in 1747 highly distinguished
themselves at Val, where Captain <span class="smcap">George Preston</span>
was wounded. His meritorious conduct was rewarded,
in 1757, with the Lieut.-Colonelcy of the Greys, at the
head of which corps he served in Germany under
Prince Ferdinand, of Brunswick, from 1758 to 1762.
At the battle of Minden in 1759, Warbourg in 1760,
Kirch Denkern in 1761, and Grobenstein in 1762, the
Greys had the honour of serving, and they signalized
themselves in numerous skirmishes, on which occasions
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Preston</span> was distinguished for discretion
and personal bravery; and he returned to England
in 1763, with the reputation of being an excellent
cavalry officer. In 1770 he was rewarded with the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
1772 he was promoted to the rank of Major-General,
and to that of Lieut.-General in 1777: in 1782 he was
appointed to the Colonelcy of the Scots' Greys. He
died at Bath in 1785.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">The Honourable Thomas Gage,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th April, 1782</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honourable Thomas Gage</span>, second son of
Thomas, first Viscount Gage, of Castle Island, in
Ireland, having served some time in the subordinate
commissions, was appointed Major of the Forty-fourth
Foot in February, 1747, and he was further promoted
to the Lieut.-Colonelcy of the regiment on the 2nd of
March, 1751. He was serving with his regiment in
America, when a dispute occurred between Great Britain
and France respecting the territory on the banks of
the Ohio, and he commanded the advance-guard of the
forces sent against Fort Du Quesne, which the French
had built to command the entrance into the country on
the Ohio and Mississippi. In the disastrous action on
the 9th of July, 1755, Major-General Braddock was
killed and Lieut.-Colonel Honourable Thomas Gage
was wounded. He continued to serve in America,
where he raised a provincial regiment, which was numbered
the Eightieth, Light-armed, Foot, of which he
was appointed Colonel in May, 1758: he was also appointed
Brigadier-General in North America, and the
efforts of the army effected the conquest of Canada,
which has continued to form part of the British dominions
from that period. He was promoted to the rank
of Major-General in 1761, and in the same year he
performed the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'duty of Commmander-'">duty of Commander-</ins>in-Chief in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
America, and also succeeded Sir Jeffrey Amherst as
Colonel-in-Chief of the Sixteenth regiment, which he
held two months, when Lieut.-General Amherst was
re-appointed. In March, 1762, he was appointed
Colonel of the Twenty-second Foot; and in April,
1770, he was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General.
When the misunderstanding between Great Britain
and her North American colonies began to assume a
serious aspect, he was appointed Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of Massachusetts Bay, and he arrived
at Boston in May, 1774. Hostilities commenced in
the following year, and his active exertions to suppress
the rebellion were rewarded in August, 1775, with the
appointment of Commander-in-Chief in North America,
which he resigned in a few months afterwards. In
April, 1782, he was appointed Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span>
Light Dragoons; he was promoted to the rank
of General in November following, and in 1785 he was
removed to the Eleventh Dragoons. He died in 1787.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Thomas Earl of Lincoln,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 4th February, 1785</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Thomas Pelham Clinton</span>, second son of
Henry, ninth Earl of Lincoln, and first Duke of Newcastle,
chusing the profession of arms, was appointed
Captain and Lieut.-Colonel in the First Foot Guards
on the 5th of April, 1775, and, on the decease of his
brother, in 1778, he obtained the title of <span class="smcap">Earl of
Lincoln</span>. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel
in 1780, and in 1782 he obtained the Colonelcy of the
Seventy-fifth, or the Prince of Wales's Regiment of
Foot, which was disbanded at the termination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
American war, in 1783. In 1785 he obtained the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons; in
1787 he was promoted to the rank of Major-General,
and he succeeded to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Duke of Newcastle</span>
on the decease of his father, in 1794. He died
in 1795.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Oliver de Lancey,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 20th May, 1795</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver de Lancey</span> descended from a respectable
family settled in North America. When a disposition
to make themselves independent appeared in the Colonies,
he wrote a pamphlet entitled, "Considerations on
the Propriety of Imposing Taxes on the British Colonies,"
which was first printed in America, and afterwards
went through the press several times in London.
Proceeding to Great Britain, he procured the commission
of Cornet in the Fourteenth Dragoons, in 1766,
and in May, 1773, he was appointed Captain in the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons, in which corps he remained
forty-nine years. In 1774 he was sent with
despatches for the Commander-in-Chief, and was
directed to provide accommodation for his regiment,
which was then under orders for America; also to provide
remount horses for his corps and for the artillery
and other departments of the army. On arriving at
Boston he was sent to New York, to accomplish the
objects of his mission; but, hostilities commencing, he
returned to Boston, where his regiment arrived about
the same time, and he remained at this place during
the blockade and bombardment, until it was evacuated
in 1776, when he proceeded to Halifax, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to Staten Island. He commanded a squadron of the
<span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> on Long Island, distinguished himself
in the driving back of the American piquets, and also at
the battle of Brooklyn. Crossing the river to New
York he had further opportunities of signalizing himself,
and in the spring of 1777 he served in the Jerseys,
where the squadron under his orders had several rencounters
with detachments of the enemy. In the following
winter he proceeded to Philadelphia, was actively
employed in the spring of 1778 in various services in
Pennsylvania, and was engaged in covering the march
of the army from thence to New York. On the 3rd of
June, 1778, he was promoted to the Majority of his
regiment, which he commanded while it was stationed
on Long Island, and afterwards in the lines in front of
New York, where skirmishes occurred almost daily.
He was subsequently appointed Deputy Quarter-Master-General
to the expedition to South Carolina, where he
served at the siege of Charlestown, and in several expeditions
under Earl Cornwallis; and in 1781 he was
promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, and appointed
Adjutant-General in America, in succession to Major
John André, who was made prisoner by the Americans
and executed as a spy. At the termination of the war
he was appointed to arrange the military claims made
by persons who had served in America; and he was
placed at the head of a commission for settling the
accounts of the army during the war. In 1790 he was
appointed Deputy Adjutant-General, with the rank of
Colonel in the army; in 1794 he obtained the Lieut.-Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth</span> Light Dragoons, and
was appointed Barrack-Master-General, which he held
ten years; he was also promoted to the rank of Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
on the 3rd of October, 1794. On the 20th of
May, 1795, he was farther rewarded with the Colonelcy
of his regiment. He was promoted to the rank of
Lieut.-General in 1801, and to that of General in 1812.
He was many years a Member of Parliament. He died
in September, 1822, after serving the crown fifty-six
years.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Lord Robert Edward Henry Somerset, K.C.B.,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 9th September, 1822</em>.</p>

<p>Removed to the Royal Dragoons in 1829, and to
the Fourth, or Queen's Own, Light Dragoons in 1836.</p>


<p class="p1 center smcap">Sir John Elley, K.C.B., K.C.H.,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 23rd November, 1829</em>.</p>

<p>This officer was a native of Leeds, and, being intended
for the law, was articled to a solicitor in London;
but preferring the profession of arms, he enlisted at
Leeds, on the 5th of November, 1789, as a private
trooper in the Royal Horse Guards (Blues). His conduct
was generally approved of by his officers, and his
attachment to the army remaining undiminished, his
father enabled him to purchase the appointment of
Quartermaster of a troop in the following year, namely,
on the 4th of June, 1790; he was promoted to a Cornetcy,
by purchase, on the 6th of June, 1794. He
accompanied the four troops of the Blues to Flanders
in 1793, as Acting Adjutant; and serving under His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, he was present at
several engagements, where the Blues distinguished
themselves, particularly at Cateau on the 26th of April,
1794, where Acting Adjutant Elley evinced signal gallantry.
He served with his regiment in the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
through Holland to Germany, and, returning to England
in November, 1795, he was promoted to a Lieutenantcy,
by purchase, on the 26th of January, 1796. The rank
of Captain-Lieutenant was conferred on this meritorious
officer on the 24th of October, 1799, and he was
promoted to Captain of a troop, by purchase, on the
26th of February, 1801. He was employed as Aide-de-camp
to Major-General Staveley on the Staff of
Great Britain, when the country was threatened with
invasion by Buonaparte. He was promoted, by purchase,
to Major of the Royal Horse Guards on the 29th
of November, 1804, and to Lieut.-Colonel, by purchase,
on the 6th of March, 1808. In 1808 he served as
Assistant Adjutant-General to the cavalry of the army,
which advanced into Spain under Lieut.-General Sir
John Moore, and was at the cavalry action at Sahagun,
where the Fifteenth Hussars highly distinguished themselves;
also at Benevente, where the French Imperial
Guards were driven across the Esla with severe loss.
Lieut.-Colonel Elley was also present at several other
skirmishes, and at the battle of Corunna. The appointment
of Assistant Adjutant-General to the cavalry of
the British army in Portugal and Spain was held by
Lieut.-Colonel Elley from 1809 to 1814; he proved a
most valuable officer, and performed the duties of his
situation with great ability during those arduous campaigns,
in which the British troops gained many honours.
He was present at most of the battles in Portugal, Spain,
and France, until the power of Buonaparte was subdued
and the Bourbon dynasty was restored to the
throne of France. He received several severe wounds,
particularly at Salamanca, where he narrowly escaped
being taken prisoner; he was promoted to the rank
of Colonel on the 7th of March, 1813: in 1815 he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
appointed Assistant Adjutant-General to the cavalry of
the army in Flanders, under His Grace the Duke of
Wellington, and served at the battle of Waterloo<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.
He was rewarded with a silver medal for the battle of
Waterloo; a cross and three clasps for the battles of
Sahagun, Benevente, Talavera, Fuentes d'Onor, Salamanca,
Vittoria, Orthes, and Toulouse. He was also
constituted Knight Commander of the Order of the
Bath; Knight Commander of the Royal Hanoverian
Guelphic Order; Knight of Maria Theresa of Austria;
Knight of St. George of Russia (fourth class). He was
promoted to the rank of Major-General on the 12th of
August, 1819; in 1821 he was appointed Governor
of Galway, and in 1829 he was rewarded with the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Seventeenth Lancers</span>: in 1837
he was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General. He
died on the 28th of January, 1839, at his residence,
near Andover, and was interred at the Chapel Royal,
at Windsor.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
